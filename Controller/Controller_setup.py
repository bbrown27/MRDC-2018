#This program uses pygame to read xbox 360/PSX controller input and send serial data
#through an xbee connected to a serial port
#data is sent and read one byte at a time
#To those who end up using this code remember to test, test, test!!! This code should be functional but you have to make sure that you understand what is going on

#There is still much that should be done to get better control of the robot
#[[[Some things that could be done to get better functionality below]]] 
#Create more levels of motor function, right now there is only 5 levels but at about 15+ levels the controls should start to feel extremely fluid
#Add constant feedback to the robot so the robot knows when a disconnect has occured(THIS IS NECESSARY FOR SAFETY AND SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE NEXT COMPETITION)
#Adjust the program so that is will automatically detect whether you are using a xbox or playstation controller
#Map out and send data on every possible button/axis/hatarray (not really nessacery for robot control but nice to have done)

#This creates the Controller class
